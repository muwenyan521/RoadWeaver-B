This project incorporates concepts and code from RoadArchitect (https://github.com/Shadscure/RoadArchitect),
specifically:

1. A* Pathfinding Algorithm (PathFinder.java)
   - Used in: common/src/main/java/net/countered/settlementroads/features/roadlogic/RoadPathCalculator.java
   - Derived from: modules/common/src/main/java/net/oxcodsnet/roadarchitect/util/PathFinder.java
   - Core algorithm structure, cost calculation system, and heuristic functions

2. Cost Calculation Constants
   - Elevation cost multiplier (40.0)
   - Biome-based penalties (water, ocean, deep ocean)
   - Diagonal movement cost calculations

3. Grid-based Pathfinding Approach
   - 8-directional neighbor offsets
   - Grid alignment and snapping mechanisms
