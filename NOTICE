This project incorporates concepts and code from RoadArchitect (https://github.com/Shadscure/RoadArchitect),
specifically:

1. A* Pathfinding Algorithm (PathFinder.java)
   - Used in: common/src/main/java/net/countered/settlementroads/features/roadlogic/RoadPathCalculator.java
   - Derived from: modules/common/src/main/java/net/oxcodsnet/roadarchitect/util/PathFinder.java
   - Core algorithm structure, cost calculation system, and heuristic functions

2. Cost Calculation Constants
   - Elevation cost multiplier (40.0)
   - Biome-based penalties (water, ocean, deep ocean)
   - Diagonal movement cost calculations

3. Grid-based Pathfinding Approach
   - 8-directional neighbor offsets
   - Grid alignment and snapping mechanisms

This project incorporates concepts and code from Countered's Settlement Roads 
(https://github.com/Countered/settlement-roads-new), specifically:

1. Road Decoration Placement Concepts
   - Distance signs with hanging signs
   - Lamppost decorations with lanterns
   - Waypoint markers with fences and torches
   - Used in: common/src/main/java/net/countered/settlementroads/features/decoration/
   - Derived from: src/main/java/net/countered/settlementroads/features/RoadStructures.java
   - Approximately 17% of the original decoration placement logic was adapted

2. Road Decoration Data Structure
   - RoadDecoration record (BlockPos, Vec3i, centerBlockCount, distance, isStart)
   - Used in: common/src/main/java/net/countered/settlementroads/helpers/Records.java
   - Derived from: src/main/java/net/countered/settlementroads/helpers/Records.java
   - Modified to include signText field

3. Feature Generation Framework
   - Road feature generation lifecycle
   - Chunk-based road placement logic
   - Used in: common/src/main/java/net/countered/settlementroads/features/RoadFeature.java
   - Derived from: src/main/java/net/countered/settlementroads/features/RoadFeature.java
   - Approximately 17% of the original framework structure was adapted

RoadWeaver's Original Improvements:
- Replaced Catmull-Rom spline curves with A* pathfinding algorithm
- Replaced in-memory caching with persistent data storage system
- Refactored decoration system into object-oriented design with 8 decoration types
- Added Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) road planning algorithm
- Added debug GUI system (6 classes, ~1400 lines)
- Added Architectury multi-platform support (Fabric + Forge)
- Added biome-aware wood selection system
- Added structure connection status management
- Added manual road connection functionality
